# YoutubePls

Too lazy to click the skip buttons in Youtube? Too much effort clicking the x on popup ads? Don't worry, this extension will do it for you.

---

Essentially, this is what this (unpacked) Chrome extension does:
 - skips ads whenever the skip button becomes available
 - clicks away popup ads in the blink of an eye
 - mutes video ads
 - click away "are you still watching" popups

All of these can be enabled and disabled. Check the YoutubePls icon in the toolbar for options.
