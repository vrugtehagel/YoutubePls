# ConvenientYoutube

Too lazy to click the skip buttons in Youtube? Too much effort clicking the x on popup ads? Don't worry, this extension will do it for you.

Essentially, this is what this (unpacked) Chrome extension does:
 - skips ads whenever the skip button becomes available
 - clicks away popup ads in the blink of an eye
 - mutes video ads
 - (tries to) click away "are you still watching" popups (not working)

All of these can be enabled and disabled. Check the icon in the toolbar for the ConvenientYoutube logo for options.
